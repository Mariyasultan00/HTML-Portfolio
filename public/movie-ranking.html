<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I think just about everything has been said about this film now. 
But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. 
To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe.
Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. 
This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. 
So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human.
 Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust...</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. 
Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. 
But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. 
This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. 
The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful.
Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie.
Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade.</p>
<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p>Despicable me is Simply Hilarious. This Movie is not just for kids, Adults are going to enjoy it even more. 
The youngest girl in it is sooooooo cute. Also the Small yellow minions simply adorable and so funny. 
The entire hall was laughing through out the movie.
The plot is very interesting to keep you engrossed throughout the movie.It is not a very original plot but has the very humorous dialogs and acts.
Steve Carell's is SIMPLY amazing, he is funny in a very different way...he is the king of the awkward embarrassing insulting type of comedy. 
You can't help but remember Steve carell's during some of the dialog deliveries.
One of the funniest animation movie. Definitely Worth Watching twice.</p>
